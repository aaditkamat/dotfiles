# Aadit Kamat's dotfiles

## Installation

**Warning:** If you want to give these dotfiles a try, you should first fork this repository, review the code, and remove things you don’t want or need. Don’t blindly use my settings unless you know what that entails. Use at your own risk!

### Using Git and the bootstrap script

You can clone the repository wherever you want. The bootstrapper script will pull in the latest version and copy the files to your home folder.

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/aaditkamat/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && source bootstrap.sh
```

To update, `cd` into your local `dotfiles` repository and then:

```zsh
source bootstrap.sh
```

Alternatively, to update while avoiding the confirmation prompt:

```zsh
set -- -f; source bootstrap.sh
```

### Git-free install

To install these dotfiles without Git:

```zsh
cd; curl -#L https://github.com/aaditkamat/dotfiles/tarball/main | tar -xzv --strip-components 1 --exclude={README.md,bootstrap.sh,.osx,LICENSE-MIT.txt}
```

To update later on, just run that command again.

### Specify the `$PATH`

If `~/.path` exists, it will be sourced along with the other files, before any feature testing (such as [detecting which version of `ls` is being used](https://github.com/aaditkamat/dotfiles/blob/92a021aecafdbe2f257a293a552d69909de83397/.aliases#L22-L29)takes place.

Here’s an example `~/.path` file that adds `/usr/local/bin` to the `$PATH`:

```zsh
export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
```

### Install Homebrew formulae

When setting up a new Mac, you may want to install some common [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) formulae (after installing Homebrew, of course):

```bash
./brew.sh
```

Some of the functionality of these dotfiles depends on formulae installed by `brew.sh`. If you don’t plan to run `brew.sh`, you should look carefully through the script and manually install any particularly important ones. A good example is Bash/Git completion: the dotfiles use a special version from Homebrew.
